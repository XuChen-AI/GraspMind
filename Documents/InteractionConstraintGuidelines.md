# Robotic Grasping Interaction Constraint Guidelines

## 1. Graspability Assessment (Primary Consideration)
Evaluate whether the object can be grasped stably and safely without damage:

### 1.1 Structural Integrity
- **Fragility Analysis**: Assess if the object will break, crack, or deform under gripper pressure
- **Material Properties**: Consider hardness, brittleness, elasticity, and surface texture
- **Critical Stress Points**: Identify vulnerable areas that could fail during grasping

### 1.2 Grasp Stability
- **Contact Points**: Ensure sufficient contact area for secure grip
- **Force Distribution**: Evaluate optimal pressure distribution to prevent damage
- **Grip Effectiveness**: Assess whether the gripper can maintain hold during movement

## 2. Safety Analysis
Comprehensive evaluation of risks associated with the grasping operation:

### 2.1 Containment Security
- **Spillage Risk**: For containers with liquids, powders, or small objects
- **Lid/Cap Integrity**: Ensure closures remain secure during handling
- **Content Displacement**: Prevent internal contents from shifting dangerously

### 2.2 Structural Safety
- **Joint Stability**: Check for loose connections or hinges
- **Weight Distribution**: Ensure balanced load during transport
- **Drop Prevention**: Minimize risk of accidental release

## 3. Human-Robot Interaction Analysis
Evaluate the psychological and ergonomic aspects of object handover:

### 3.1 Psychological Comfort
- **Threat Perception**: Avoid presenting sharp, pointed, or intimidating aspects
- **Predictable Motion**: Use smooth, deliberate movements during handover
- **Clear Intent**: Make grasping and handover intentions obvious to humans

### 3.2 Ergonomic Considerations
- **Handover Position**: Present objects at comfortable height and angle
- **Grip Orientation**: Enable easy human grasping without awkward hand positions
- **Transfer Timing**: Allow adequate time for human to prepare for reception

## 4. Specific Object Guidelines and Examples

### 4.1 Handled Objects
- **Cups/Mugs**: Always grasp by the handle when available
  - Reasoning: Prevents contact with drinking surface, maintains hygiene
  - Alternative: If handle unavailable, grasp base or sides away from rim
- **Bags/Briefcases**: Use handles or designated carrying points
- **Tools with Handles**: Grip non-functional end (handle rather than working surface)

### 4.2 Sharp Objects
- **Scissors**: Never present pointed ends toward humans
  - Proper Orientation: Hold by blades (safely), present handle end first
  - Alternative Method: Present with blades closed and pointing downward
- **Knives**: Grasp handle, present handle-first with blade pointing away
- **Needles/Pins**: Use protective covers or present in containers

### 4.3 Fragile Items
- **Glassware**: Use distributed pressure, avoid concentration at single points
- **Electronics**: Avoid pressure on screens, buttons, or sensitive components
- **Artwork/Photos**: Handle edges only, never touch surface areas

### 4.4 Food Items
- **Fruits**: Grasp at stem end or areas that won't be consumed
- **Packaged Foods**: Hold by packaging, not edible contents
- **Utensils**: Present handle-first, avoid contact with food-contact surfaces

### 4.5 Liquid Containers
- **Bottles**: Grasp body or base, ensure cap is secure before lifting
- **Open Containers**: Move slowly, keep level, consider spillage protection
- **Spray Bottles**: Avoid accidental trigger activation during transport

### 4.6 Heavy/Awkward Objects
- **Books**: Support from bottom, avoid gripping pages or cover edges
- **Boxes**: Use corners or designated lifting points
- **Cylindrical Objects**: Ensure grip prevents rolling or slipping

## 5. Decision Matrix for Grasp Planning

### Priority Hierarchy:
1. **Safety First**: No risk to humans or environment
2. **Object Integrity**: Preserve object functionality and appearance
3. **Efficiency**: Optimize for speed while maintaining safety
4. **User Comfort**: Minimize human stress and awkwardness

### Risk Assessment Scale:
- **High Risk**: Requires specialized handling or alternative approach
- **Medium Risk**: Proceed with enhanced caution and monitoring
- **Low Risk**: Standard grasping protocols apply

## 6. Exception Handling
- **Unknown Objects**: Default to most conservative approach
- **Multi-material Objects**: Apply strictest constraint from any component
- **Dynamic Conditions**: Adjust parameters based on environmental factors (wind, vibration, etc.)
